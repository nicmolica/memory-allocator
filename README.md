# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must use your VM or login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The examples I provide below are designed strictly for the linux machine architecture(s) we are using in this class. This is the  architecture where your submission will be graded.
